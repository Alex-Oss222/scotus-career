# OT1997 chunk 12 — June 26 heading-format review addendum

The completed technical normalization passes independent byte comparison. This addendum leaves [the substantive June 26 review](OT_1997CHUNK12_JUNE26_REVIEW.md) unchanged and supplements its recorded assembly-stage hashes.

Using [the normalization receipt](OT_1997CHUNK12_HEADING_NORMALIZATION.json) and the byte-original copies in `tmp/chunk12_heading_normalization_before/`, the reviewer verified all three June 26 Records. Each changed exactly eleven Public Projection block prefixes from `###` to `##`, removing one ASCII `#` per block: **33 bytes and 33 characters in total**. The eleven blocks remain in the required order. Forward normalization reproduces each current file exactly; inverse normalization restores every original byte. The internal Record, all substantive public text, whitespace, line endings and every other byte are unchanged.

Every saved original matches both its normalization-receipt hash and its hash in the earlier independent-review receipt. Current raw-file SHA-256 hashes are:

| Record | Current SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| Bauchman | `b5e967ab2aadf4d5ddce9c7da72fd23b03f2d3971cd65295ab1033064257ab25` |
| Burlington / Ellerth | `d0ffac454f7446701ebaea3a1156e8c4cc6ecec1639855b7aec4c5dce1b2ccc7` |
| Monge | `6e5bfeafd512d685a88cd23c299a012698b39e45c3b4f2e651b269e90c8ee56c` |

The mechanical evidence is saved in [chunk12_june26_format_review_checks.json](../../../tmp/chunk12_june26_format_review_checks.json). The prior review memo remains SHA-256 `a45bcdaf7e2d7649cc83d4692c265e5b94004aa469a31f8fd75cb0746fd9759f`.

This is initial Run integration formatting for the stock checker's exact heading requirement, not an adjudicative change. The earlier review conclusion remains effective; its earlier hashes accurately identify the stage reviewed. Frozen reading copies retain identical legal content and need no substantive revision because of this normalization. This bounded check does not replace the operator's separate artifact-guard, snapshot or workspace validation. The reviewer changed no Record, prior memo or prior receipt and used no Git or private-path access. No format-review discrepancy remains.
